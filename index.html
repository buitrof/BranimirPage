  <h2 class="title">In memory of Josip Kovač</h2>

  <div class="paragraph-div">
    <p class="paragraph">
      It is with a heavy heart that we announce the passing of long time parishioner, Josip Kovač, loving husband, father,
      grandfather and brother on Thursday, August 26. Josip is survived by his wife Zora Kovač, son Branimir and wife Lucy,
      son Kresimir and wife Tanya, son Zvonimir, and grandchildren Ivana, Petar, Isabella, Michael, and Joseph. Josip was
      born on January 2, 1940 in the small village of Vinica, Croatia. He lived his life with a commitment to faith, country,
      family and acts of service. His quest for freedom led him to travel the world, living in Australia, Spain, Paraguay,
      and finally the United States, creating treasured memories and cherished friendships. He will be missed by all. We wish to
      honor his legacy with a celebration of life. Mass will be held on Friday, September 24, 2021, at Saint Vincent De Paul
      in Huntington Beach at 10:30 AM with burial and reception to follow. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to
      the <a href="https://www.cancerresearch.org/">Cancer Research Institute</a> in honor of the deceased.
